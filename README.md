# Brittanys-Portfolio

## Welcome to my first working version of my portfolio!

In this first version, some of my objectives include:
- A header with working navigation links.
- An about me section with a photo of myself.
- Beginner template for portfolio projects.
- Contact section with links to Github, Email and LinkedIn
- Aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- Flexible layouts using flexbox for mobile responsiveness.
- Organized and concise stylesheet.
- Github commits to track work history.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://bganser15.github.io/brittanys-portfolio/).
